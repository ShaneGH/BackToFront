Hole in dependencies. What if user creates instance of DependencyWrapper

Thoughts on validation attribute: 
	Find all rules which target the member in question
	filter by those which do not have dependencies
	filter by rules which appear in a Require statement (not an if)
	add filtered rules to a validation context (TargetedRules)
	ensure each rule will only validate if it is on of the TargetedRules or TargetedRules == null
	cache result of validation in ValidationAttribute validationContext 

Reflection: if a parent type implements an interface, does the child type aswell?
