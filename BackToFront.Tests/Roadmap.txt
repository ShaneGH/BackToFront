More Expression types

unit test BackToFront.Logic.ValidateResult<TEntity>

Hole in dependencies (what if user creates instance of DependencyWrapper)

Thoughts on a profiler:	
	Each sub rule registers itself with its parent rule.
	Each ExpressionBase element registers itself with its parent rule.
	Therefore each rule has access to all of its properties
	Finally, if a rule breaks, we need to know what property broke it. Can we attach an expression to a violation?
