Unit test all Meta classes and Properties
unit test BackToFront.Logic.ValidateResult<TEntity>

Do I need to look at multiple require thats in one block again? I don't remember wrapping it up
(RequireThat(X).WithModelViolation(V).RequireThat(Y).WithModelViolation(V))

Client side
Domain Model

ConstantExpressionMeta. Need to serialize the Value

If validating children, ensure child object is not mocked out

Special case for IEnumerables
IEnumerables: IfAll, IfAny, RequireThatAll, RequreThatAny, ElseIfAll, ElseIfAny etc.....

Lambdas within rule definition, e.g. If(a => a.Any(b => b.Selected)).Then.....
