			unit test all NewCompiles
			Unit test all Meta Properties, framework and expression

Client side
Domain Model

unit test BackToFront.Logic.ValidateResult<TEntity>

IEnumerables: IfAll, IfAny, RequireThatAll, RequreThatAny, ElseIfAll, ElseIfAny etc.....

Lambdas within rule definition, e.g. If(a => a.Any(b => b.Selected)).Then.....
