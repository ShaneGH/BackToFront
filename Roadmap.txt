Short term:	
			fix unit tests
			delete constructors which should be deleted
			unit test all NewCompiles
			unit test Visitor


Remove RuleWrapper class

Client side
Domain Model

unit test BackToFront.Logic.ValidateResult<TEntity>

Duplicate everything in BacktoFront.Framework namespace into BacktoFront.Builder namespace and split rule building and rule execution logic
Compile pre-mocked rules, can already comile pre mocked expressions

Hole in dependencies. What if user gets hold of an instance of DependencyWrapper

Define rule: must have same dependencies as parent class rule

If validating children, ensure child object is not mocked out

Special case for IEnumerables
IEnumerables: IfAll, IfAny, RequireThatAll, RequreThatAny, ElseIfAll, ElseIfAny etc.....

Lambdas within rule definition, e.g. If(a => a.Any(b => b.Selected)).Then.....

More Expression types

Unit test all Meta Properties, framework and expression
